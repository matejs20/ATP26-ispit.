## User Experience Design
User experience design (UXD) defines the experience a user goes through when interacting with a company, its services, and products. UXD is user-centered, meaning design decisions are based on research, data analysis, and test results rather than purely aesthetic preferences. Unlike user interface design, which focuses only on interfaces, UX design encompasses all aspects of a user's perceived experience, including usability, usefulness, desirability, brand perception, and overall performance.

## History
User experience design has evolved from the study of human factors and ergonomics, focusing on interaction between humans, machines, and environments. Don Norman coined the term "user experience" in the early 1990s, highlighting the importance of designing for the full range of human experiences with products and systems.

## Elements of User Experience
UX design is rooted in understanding human behavior, psychology, and ergonomics. It combines elements of visual design, interaction design, usability, and human-computer interaction to create meaningful experiences.

> “I invented the term because I thought human interface and usability were too narrow. I wanted to cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system including industrial design graphics, the interface, the physical interaction and the manual. Since then the term has spread widely, so much so that it is starting to lose its meaning.”
> — Donald Norman

## The process of user experience design
Usability measures how effectively users can achieve goals with a product, combining efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Good usability is essential for positive UX but does not guarantee it alone.

## UX design testing
Once designers understand user needs, they create wireframes, visual frameworks, and prototypes. Iterative testing and usability evaluation ensure the product works as intended. Methods include A/B testing, persona development, and automated testing environments.
